## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.0+)
- MongoDB (Local instance or Atlas Cluster)
- NPM or Yarn

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SahilSonawane24/fees-Management-system.git
cd fees-Management-system
```

### 2. Backend Configuration
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://your_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_robust_jwt_secret_key
NODE_ENV=development
```
**Seed the database (Optional):**
```bash
npm run data:import
```
**Launch Development Server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Run Frontend + Backend Together:**
You can run both the backend and frontend dev servers with a single command from the project root. First install root dev dependencies, then run:

```bash
# from project root
npm install
npm run dev
```
This uses `concurrently` to run `backend` and `frontend` `npm run dev` scripts in parallel (auto-restarts and HMR enabled).

### 3. Frontend Configuration
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```
**Launch Development Server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
